# MGHS Intern Certificate Management

![Main Page](mainpage.png)

This project proposal aims to develop a comprehensive website for generating and managing certificates. The envisioned platform will provide a suite of features to enhance the certification process. Key functionalities include the verification of certificates, options for printing and sharing, multi-language support, and various customization tools. Additionally, the system will incorporate an export function to delete the certificate from the database upon export automatically and complete automation process of certificate generation in wordpress. Despite removing the certificate, the system will retain a textual record of the intern's details and certification history. This project seeks to streamline the certification process, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility.
